# Note-Taker

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Description:

This is a note taking application that allows the user to save and delete notes, with a note title and text to write content underneath. It's powered by ExpressJS.



## The Process:
- Referred to the mock to get an understanding of the note taking app and it's functionality
- Rewatched class videos and referred to some of Star Wars activity in class
- Referred to documentation
- Page must be refreshed to see notes that were deleted. Couldn't figure out a fix for that.
